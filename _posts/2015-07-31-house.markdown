<p>Some things in our life most of us do just very rarely.
But when you do such thing you want to make sure it is
done in the right way. One of such thing is buying a property
for living. It can be a pleasure, but it can easily become
a nightmare.
</p>

<p>It's said that investment in property is both lucrative and safe.
However, this claim isn't usually backed by a reasonable amount of
data since in many countries it's not easy to get prices
of sold properties.
</p>

<p>Luckily, in some countries we can verify this assertion on the
representative amount of data. In fact, we can have a look at prices
development in one of the most developed economy in the world.
UK government publishes each month paid prices of
properties in England &amp; Wales.
</p>

<p>The data have 20 million sales records since
1995, with the total sale of £3.24 trillion (i.e. 3 million million).
It records more than a third of all property transactions
in England &amp; Wales (not all are recorded).
With this data, everyone can see development of real sold prices
of properties. We built a live <a href="http://house.briskat.com">dashboard</a>
to explore this data using our interactive <a href="/#TECHNOLOGY">technology</a>.
</p>

Eg. in the dashboard, you can see that an average price in 1995
was £69k while now it's £261k. The annual average wage in 1995
was £13.3k and it's £25k now. So to buy a property of
an average price in 1995 took 5 annual gross incomes
while now it takes 10 (if we took median price it would be
4 incomes in 1995 and 8 in 2015).
</p>
<p>Overall in the last 20 years the average price grew up each
year except the years 2008 (-1%,-£2.5k), 2011 (-2%,-£3.5k) and
2009 (-2%,-£3.6k). The highest year over year price growth
was in 2004 with 15%, £+22.9k.
</p>

<h3>Price change by postal code</h3>
<p>Let's have a closer look on how prices changed in some postal codes
over the last years. The region with the lowest increase is Durham
where prices grew up by 168% (e.g.
on average what used to cost 100k in 1995 now costs 268k in 2015).
I.e. even if you bought a property in the area with the lowest price
increase it was still a safe investment.
</p>
<p>However, if you look at the property as an investment
London is a clear winner. There is only one postal code in the top 10
postal codes which is outside of London area. Prices in these top
10 areas grew up by 350% or more in the last 20 years.

</p>
<p>In May of this year the winner postal code was WC London with 515% prices growth,
however West London overtook it in June with 531% prices increase.
In WC London the last year there were 380 properties sales.
The average price reached staggering £1.06 million.
</p>
<p>
<img src="/img/posts/8_flats_yoy.png" class="img-responsive" alt="Yoy prices">
But London is not the only place where there is really high increase.
When we filter out flats only, Brighton actually goes to the 4th place with 444% growth (£40k in 1995, £219k in 2015).
Also, Truro squeezes into top ten with 380% growth (£42k in 1995, £203k in 2015).
</p>

<h3>Can we expect prices to drop?</h3>
<p>To sum it up on average buying a house in England is, in general, a safe investment.
The property prices grew up higher than the inflation.
The growth is not so surprising, when we consider
England is already the second most crowded major country in the EU.
The population grew by more than 10% in the last 20 years.
Based on the presumption the population growth is expected to continue
significant prices decrease is implausible in the coming years.
</p>
<p>But this also has an important downside. Buying own property on average
is two times less affordable than it was 20 years ago.
